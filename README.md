This application allows a user to view their full Spotify history, parsing the data from their extended streaming history on Spotify's website.
Currently, this shows your Top 25 Artists, Top 25 Songs, Top 25 Albums, and then shows Top 5 Artists by Year, going from whatever year the first song was listened, to current year.
The process for downloading the extended history takes Spotify up to a month (but more likely a week or two) to process, so it takes time.


Downloading Extended Streaming History
1. Navigate to Spotify.com
2. On the top right, click your profile picture, then "Account"
3. Under Security and Privacy, click "Privacy Settings"
4. Scroll down to Download your Data, then select "Extended Streaming History" and deselect everything else
5. "Request Data", then wait about 2 or so weeks for your information to come in. It'll be emailed to you as a zip file from noreply@spotify.com

To run the app, just donwload this and open the file to show the GUI. Select the select the zip file, or extract the data and select all the "endsong_x.json" files, and it'll show your stats!

Normally, Spofify wrapped or statsforspotify only goes back a few years, and I never thought that was very indicative of my true music history, so I decided to make this. At some point in the past few years, spotify
stopped showing your full history in Spotify Wrapped, and instead moved it into an extended streaming history file. This makes that file readable and shows any useful info you may want to know.
